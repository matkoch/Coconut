A handful of experimental ReSharper features. Currently contains:

- ContextAction "Switch VsSettings"
- ContextAction "Switch to last VsSettings"
- Replacing GotoDeclaration for type members in debug mode:
  - Going to actual member declaration if possible
  - Otherwise, expanding implementing types
